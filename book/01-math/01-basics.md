## Variables

```{index} variable
```

A variable is a symbol that refers to an unspecified object.

We use mathematical typesetting, such as $a$ and $x$, for mathematical variable
symbols. By contrast, we use fixed font typesetting, such as `a` and `x`, for
programming variable names.

The information above is lifted from
[a Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)).

We say that the variable **represents** or **denotes** the object. The
variable's **value** is any valid candidate for the object.
